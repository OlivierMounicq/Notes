## Applying Functional Principles in C#

### 1/ Functional Programming Features

- C# 3.0 : LINQ, Extension method  
- C# 6.0 : Read-only properties  
- C# 7.0 : pattern matching

### 2/ What is Functional Programming ?

- Mathemtical function != Class method  

#### 2.1/ Same input, same results

A method with same input  same result: 

```cs
public double Calculate (double x, double y)
{
  return x*x + y*y;
}
```

Here, the result is always different (the method uses a global state DateTime.Now will always change)
```cs
public long TicksElapsedFrom(int year)
{
  DateTime now = DateTime.Now //Global state
  DateTime then = new DateTime(year,1,1);
  return (now-then).Ticks;
}
```

Here, the method is not a functional function because either the method returns an integer or throw an exception if y equal to 0:  
```cs
public static int Divide(int x, int y)
{
  return x / y;
} 
```  
=> It means that the method's signature does not convey enough information about the result of the operation 


#### 2.2/ Method signature honesty

method signature = (all possible inputs , all possible outcomes)  

_Dishonest signature_ : 
```cs
public static int Divide(int x, int y)
{
  return x / y;
} 
```  
 
_honest signature_ :
```cs
public static int Divide(int x, NonZeroInteger y)
{
  return x / y.Value;
} 
```  
Or

```cs
public static int? Divide(int x, int y)
{
  if(y == 0)
    return null;
    
  return x/y;  
} 
```

#### 2.3/ Mathematical function

- __Honest__ : has precisely defined input and output  
- __Referentially transparent__ : does not affect or refer  to the global state


### 3/ Why Functional Programming ?

- could help to reduce complexity
- not depend on a global stae
- each function contains all information to compute the output => the code is more raeadable
- we use the composition of the function to create a complex algorithm
- it's easier for the unit test : no need to create mocks to test the function
